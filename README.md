# light-dark-mode-switching-function
A light/dark mode switching function via jQuery for application. I amusing the jQuery .attr() method to dynamically set or change the value of href attribute of
a link or anchor tag. 
This method can also be used to get the value of any attribute.Feel free to download and have a try!:D
