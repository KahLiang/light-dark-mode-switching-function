# light-dark-mode-switching-function
A light/dark mode switching function via jQuery for application. I am using the jQuery *.attr()* method to dynamically set or change the value of href attribute of
a link or anchor tag. 

This method can also be used to get the value of any attribute. Feel free to download and have a try!:D
